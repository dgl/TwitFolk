TwitFolk - an IRC/Twitter gateway bot
=====================================

Overview
--------

Gate the tweets/dents from a Twitter or Identi.ca account's list of friends
into an IRC channel.

History
-------

Some people in an IRC channel started noticing that conversations kept crossing
over between IRC and Twitter, so they talked about gating each other's tweets
into the channel:

Eventually someone quickly knocked a bot together:

Then a couple of other channels started using it.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Perl (>=5.10)

- Some Perl modules:
	- Net::Twitter
        - EV
        - AnyEvent::Twitter::Stream
        - AnyEvent::IRC
        - MooseX::Daemonize
        - Config::Tiny
        - Try::Tiny
	- HTML::Entities

    It might be easiest to use cpanm with a local::lib to use these modules:

        wget -qO ~/bin/cpanm cpanmin.us 
        chmod 755 ~/bin/cpanm
        cpanm --local-lib=./twitfolk-libs Net::Twitter AnyEvent::Twitter::Stream AnyEvent::IRC MooseX::Daemonize Config::Tiny Try::Tiny
        [wait a rather long time]

        Then run with:

        PERL5LIB=./twitfolk-libs ./twitfolk.pl

- A twitter.com or identi.ca account

Source

You can get it from our Subversion repository:

Support
-------

Limited community support is available from the TwitFolk users mailing list:

	https://lists.bitfolk.com/mailman/listinfo/twitfolk

Feature suggestions would be great, too.

You can follow TwitFolk development on Identi.ca:

	http://identi.ca/twitfolk

which is also gated to Twitter:

	http://twitter.com/therealtwitfolk

(The "twitfolk" username was already taken on Twitter; if you own it and want
to give it up, please let us know!)
