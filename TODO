- Ignore features

Would be nice if people / hashtags could be (temporarily?) ignored in some
fashion, for example when an otherwise-interesting person is tweeting about a
conference that's not of interest.

- Self service features

There should be some way for users in the channel to indicate that they want to
be added or removed.

Similarly, they should be able to indicate that their IRC nick has changed.
